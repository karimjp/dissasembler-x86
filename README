To start the dissasembler please do the following:

1. open dissasembler.py and from line 8 uncomment the byte file you want to test the dissasembler with.
#binaryPath="test1"
#binaryPath="res/example1.o"
#binaryPath="res/example2.o"
binaryPath="res/ex2"

2. save and from the shell execute:
	python dissasembler.py


Choosen Algorithm: Linear Sweep
Weaknesses:
	- This is a "less smart than recursive" algorithm because it 
	attempts to execute line by line and if a data section is
	encounter the bytes will be handle as possible opcodes to 
	continue the dissasemble process.
